## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. Merge the datasets Customers, Product Hierarchy and Transactions as Customer_Final. Ensure to keep all customers who have done transactions with us and select the join type accordingly. a. Use the base merge() b. Dplyr merge functions



```{r}

setwd("F:\\Analytix_Labs\\R for Data Science\\R Case Studies\\R - Retail Case study\\R case study 1 (Retail)")
getwd()
prod_cat_info <- read.csv("prod_cat_info.csv")
Transactions <- read.csv("Transactions.csv")
Customer <- read.csv("Customer.csv")
head(prod_cat_info)
head(Transactions)
head(Customer)


prod1 <- merge.data.frame(x = Transactions,y = prod_cat_info,by.x ="prod_subcat_code",by.y ="prod_cat_code")

is.null(prod1)
unique(prod1)
library(dplyr)
prod1 %>% distinct()
Customer_Final <- merge.data.frame(x = prod1,y = Customer,by.x = "cust_id",by.y = "customer_Id")


library(dplyr)


prod2<- left_join(x = Transactions,y = prod_cat_info,by=c("prod_subcat_code"="prod_cat_code"))

prod2%>% distinct()
sum(is.na(prod2))

Customer_Final2<- left_join(x = prod2,y = Customer,by=c("cust_id"="customer_Id"))

```
#2. Prepare a summary report for the merged data set. 
#a. Get the column names and their corresponding data types 
```{r}

str(Customer_Final)


```


#b. Top/Bottom 10 observations
```{r}
head(Customer_Final)
tail(Customer_Final)


```

#c.  “Five-number summary” for continuous variables (min, Q1, median, Q3 and max)
```{r}
str(Customer_Final)
info1 <- Customer_Final[,c(1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9)]
summary(info1)

```


#d. Frequency tables for all the categorical variables

```{r}
class(Customer_Final)
as.data.frame(Customer_Final)

sapply(Customer_Final, class)

str(Customer_Final)

sapply(Customer_Final, is.factor)

as.factor(Customer_Final$Store_type)
#is.factor(Customer_Final$Store_type)

Customer_Final[sapply(Customer_Final, is.character)] <- lapply(Customer_Final[sapply(Customer_Final, is.character)],as.factor)
str(Customer_Final)

info <- Customer_Final[,c("prod_cat","prod_subcat","Gender","Store_type")]
table(info)
library(plyr)

count(info$prod_cat)
count(info$prod_subcat)
count(info$Gender)
count(info$Store_type)

```
#3. Generate histograms for all continuous variables and frequency bars for categorical variables

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

sum(is.na(info))
sum(is.na(info1))

table(info)
typeof(info)
class(info)

str(info)
library(ggplot2)

info[sapply(info,is.character)] <- lapply(info[sapply(info, is.character)],as.factor)

plotinfo<- function(x){

a <-ggplot2::qplot(x)
  plot(a)
  
}

sapply(X = info,FUN = plotinfo)

```
#4. Calculate the following information using the merged dataset :
#a. Time period of the available transaction data
```{r}
str(Customer_Final)


as.Date(Customer_Final$tran_date,format = "%d-%m-%Y","%d/%m/%Y")

a <- as.Date(Customer_Final$tran_date,format="%d-%m-%Y")
b <- as.Date(Customer_Final$tran_date,format="%d/%m/%Y")

a[is.na(a)] <- b[!is.na(b)]
Customer_Final$tran_date <- a

Customer_Final$tran_date
class(Customer_Final$tran_date)
```


#b. Count of transactions where the total amount of transaction was negative
```{r}

#has.neg <- apply(Customer_Final, 1, function(row) any(row < 0))
#which(has.neg)
#length(which(has.neg))

nrow(Customer_Final[Customer_Final$total_amt<0,])


```
#5. Analyze which product categories are more popular among females vs male customers.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

Customer_Final%>%group_by(Gender,prod_cat)%>%summarise(sum(Qty>0))





```


#6. Which City code has the maximum customers and what was the percentage of customers from that city?
```{r}


library(dplyr)
city_code1 <- Customer_Final %>%group_by(city_code) %>%summarise(n_distinct(cust_id))
city_code1
#citycode 3 has maxium customers

percentage1 <- (514/sum(city_code1$`n_distinct(cust_id)`))*100


percentage1


```
#7. Which store type sells the maximum products by value and by quantity?

```{r}

library(dplyr)
Customer_Final%>%group_by(Store_type)%>% summarise(sum(total_amt,Qty))

#Eshop is selling maxium products

```

#8. What was the total amount earned from the "Electronics" and "Clothing" categories from Flagship Stores?


```{r}
library(dplyr)

Customer_Final%>%group_by(prod_cat)%>%summarise(sum(total_amt,na.rm = TRUE))

#Electronics 31484456	
#Clothing    18589406	

```
#9. What was the total amount earned from "Male" customers under the "Electronics" category?

```{r}
Customer_Final$Gender
sum(is.na(Customer_Final$Gender))

library(dplyr)
male <- Customer_Final%>%group_by(Gender,prod_cat)%>%summarise(sum(total_amt,na.rm = TRUE))

male_customer <- male[male$Gender=="M"&male$prod_cat=="Electronics",]

male_customer





```

#10. How many customers have more than 10 unique transactions, after removing all transactions which have any negative amounts?

```{r}

library(dplyr)

a1<- Customer_Final[Customer_Final$total_amt>0,]
a1<- a1[a1$transaction_id>10,]

unique1 <-a1%>%group_by(cust_id)%>%summarise(distinct =n_distinct(transaction_id),sum=sum(total_amt))
 
unique1




```

#11. For all customers aged between 25 - 35, find out: 



```{r}
#a. What was the total amount spent for “Electronics” and “Books” product categories?

str(Customer_Final)


Customer_Final$DOB <- as.Date(Customer_Final$DOB,format = "%d-%m-%Y")
class(Customer_Final$DOB)
Customer_Final$DOB


library(eeptools)
Customer_Final$Age <- floor(age_calc(Customer_Final$DOB,enddate = Sys.Date(), units = "years"))

library(dplyr)

age1 <-Customer_Final%>% filter( between(Age, 25, 35))%>% group_by(prod_cat)%>%summarise(Total_Amount =sum(total_amt,na.rm = TRUE))

age1


```
```{r}
#b. What was the total amount spent by these customers between 1st Jan, 2014 to 1st Mar, 2014?

age2<- Customer_Final%>%filter(between(Age, 25, 35))
age2
age2%>%filter(tran_date >= "2014-01-01", tran_date <= "2014-03-01")%>%summarise(Total_Amount =sum(total_amt,na.rm = TRUE))
